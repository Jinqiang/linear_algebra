\chapter{Abstract}
The role of mathematics in science is about casting our concepts about the real world into rigorous mathematical form. But, science doesn't do that for its own sake. It does so, in order to fully explore the implications of what our concepts about the real world are. To certain extent, the spirit of science can be casted into the words of Ludwig Wittgenstein, who said: \emph{What we cannot speak about clearly then we must pass over in silence}. Indeed, if we have concepts about the real world and it's not possible to cast them into precise mathematical language, that is usually an indicator that some aspects of these concepts have not been well understood. But then mathematics is just that, a language. And, if we want to extract physical conclusions from this formulation we must interpret that language. But again citing Wittgenstein: \emph{The theorems of mathematics all say the same: namely nothing}. Obviously, he didn't mean that mathematics is useless. He just refers to the fact that if we have a theorem of the type: A if and only if B. A and B being propositions, then obviously B says nothing else than A does. And A says nothing else than B does. This is what is called in mathematics a tautology. However psychologically, for our understanding of A, it may be very useful to have a reformulation of A in terms of B. 

Thus, with the understanding that mathematics just gives us a language for what we want to do, the objective of the course is to provide proper mathematical language to build the concepts addressed later on by the different sciences.
